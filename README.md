# üìÅ File Storage System

A **Java Spring Boot** application for storing and retrieving files using multiple cloud and on-premise object storage options ‚Äî **AWS S3**, **Google Cloud Storage (GCP Bucket)**, and **MinIO** ‚Äî along with **PostgreSQL** for storing file metadata.  
This system provides REST APIs to upload, download, and manage files efficiently in a cloud-native, scalable, and vendor-agnostic way.
